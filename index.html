  <h1>DIG 245 Hello World!</h1>
  <h3>What is your name, year of school, and major?</h3>
  <p>My name is Erina Lee. I'm a junior majoring in English and
    minoring in Data Science.</p>
  <h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
  <p>I want to build an online portfolio of my work as an
    English major. I'm also interested in the mechanics of
    alternate reality games, which often take advantage of website
    features to hide puzzles and narratives in plain sight.</p>
  <h3>What experience do you have creating content for the web
    or programming?</h3>
  <p>I've taken programming classes such as Data Structures and
    Programming and Problem Solving, so I've worked with Python, Java,
    and R. I'm not at all proficient in those languages, though.
    I frequent some niche hobby forums so I'm familiar with
    BBCode.</p>
  <h3>What are your goals in this course?</h3>
  <p>I want to be able to build that portfolio I mentioned
    earlier. I also want to understand how websites work in
    general, as right now they might as well happen by magic
    for all I know.</p>
  <h3>In 100-150 words, summarize the learn-computing activity
    you did with your group.</h3>
  <p>I worked with Meng on the Command Line, Shell, Terminal, Bash
    activity. We learned how to give commands to the computer operating
    system through the command line. Some useful commands include:
    <i>pwd</i>, which prints your current working directory; <i>ls</i>, which
    displays the contents of said directory; and <i>cd</i>, which changes
    to a new directory. We made a new directory labeled "test,"
    opening an Explorer window so we could see it appear in the GUI.
    We then created a file named "hello.txt" with the <i>touch</i> command
    and edited it in Vim. We then viewed the new contents of the file
    with the <i>cat</i> command. We created a Python script named "hello.py"
    in Vim as well. After pasting some test code into the script, we
    ran it with the command <i>python hello.py</i>.</p>
  <h3>What are three projects you consider to be interesting for
    artistic, cultural, or other reasons?</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ilovebees.co/">I Love Bees</a>: I mentioned ARGs
      before. This site was the base of a viral marketing campaign for the
      release of <i>Halo 2</i>, featuring a fictional beekeeper whose blog had
      been overtaken by a confused artifical intelligence. The campaign
      has long since reached its conclusion, but I Love Bees continues
      to stay up as an artifact of transmedia storytelling.</li>
    <li><a href="http://numeral.com/appletsoftware/eicon.html">
        Every Icon</a>: This is a web-based piece of conceptual art, consisting
      of a 32 x 32 square grid of either black or white squares. By progressing
      through combinations of black and white squares until every square is black,
      it will one day, trillions upon trillions of years later, have shown every
      possible image. If it still exists by then.</li>
    <li><a href="https://nickm.com/montfort_strickland/sea_and_spar_between/index.html">
        Sea and Spar Between</a>: This is a random poetry generator that
      draws upon Emily Dickinson's poems and lines from Herman Melville's
      <i>Moby Dick</i>. It maps each of the resulting 225 trillion stanzas,
      comparable to the number of fish in the sea, to unique XY coordinates.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <!-- During the learn-computing part of the assignment, it took me awhile
to figure out how to run the Python script. For some reason the terminal
kept telling me that the file couldn't be found in the current directory,
though it was there the whole time. I ended up starting over and retracing
my steps. It worked that time. Not sure what went wrong the first. -->
